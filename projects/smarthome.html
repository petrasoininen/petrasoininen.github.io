          <h4>Team</h4>
          <p>
            First, I worked with designers Maila Halme and Valtteri Otranen
            during the research phase of the project. After that, I worked with
            designers Ville Forsberg, Sofia Mesterton, and Roosa Väisänen on the
            remaining phases of the project
          </p>
          <h4>My role</h4>
          <p>
            The user research and overall design process were carried out
            collaboratively as a team. I was primarily responsible for the views
            related to home data tracking and how to manage all home functions
            at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was part of my studies at the Design Institute of LAB
            University of Applied Sciences.

          <h3>Goal of the project</h3>
          <p>
            Our goal was to research how potential customers perceive smart
            homes and their features, as well as what kinds of functions they
            would like a smart home to offer and what data they would be
            interested in tracking about their home. Based on the research, we
            created an interactive prototype for the client — a modern living
            application that combines digital home management with features such
            as viewing the community bulletin board.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="process">
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            The process was divided into two parts — research and design — as
            the project took place over two courses.
            <br /><br />
            During the research phase, my team focused on home management and
            its features. We were also assigned to compile the main survey,
            which included questions gathered from all teams involved in the
            project. Based on the research, we created user personas, user
            stories, and mapped out user journeys for the application.
            <br /><br />
            In the design phase, my team concentrated on home management and
            data tracking. We also designed the prototype’s homepage and its key
            features, which were mandatory for all teams. The project details
            are covered by an NDA.

              <p>
                The home page provides quick and easy access to the home’s
                essential functions, ensuring smooth and efficient control.

              <p>
                The features of your home can be easily managed either as a
                whole or room by room. In addition, you can choose from preset
                themes that automatically adjust lighting and other settings to
                match the selected theme.

                Home data such as temperature, humidity, and air quality can be
                easily monitored for the entire home or for individual rooms,
                and compared to the average of the housing company.

          <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
          <p>
            In the project, we had the opportunity to work with a client who
            already had a strong brand identity, design system, and a
            well-defined project workflow. It was also interesting to continue
            the project with different teams after the research phase, as this
            allowed me to learn how to interpret research conducted by others
            and make design decisions based on their findings.
