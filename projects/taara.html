            I worked with designers Melissa Airaksinen, Emmi Anttonen & Krista

          </p>
          <h4>My role</h4>
          <p>
            The user research and overall design process were carried out
            collaboratively as a team. I was mainly responsible for the profile
            and data tracking views, and I also created the majority of the
            prototyping.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was part of my studies at the Design Institute of LAB
            University of Applied Sciences.

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Sitting for long periods increases the risk of musculoskeletal
            disorders. The most effective way to prevent these issues is by
            taking regular and active breaks. Even light exercise with an
            exercise stick improves blood circulation and refreshes the mind.
            <br /><br />
            The challenge is:
            <strong
              >How can we encourage employees to momentarily pause their work
              and take an active break that enhances well-being and mental
              clarity?</strong
            >

        </div>
        <div id="solution">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            The Taara app is designed to serve as
            <strong>an exercise library</strong> and a
            <strong>reminder</strong> to take breaks during the workday. Users
            can log their completed exercises and track their duration.
            <strong>Gamified features</strong> encourage movement and enhance
            user engagement.

          <h3>User research</h3>
          <p>
            We conducted user research through a survey and user interviews.
            <br /><br />
            The goal of the research was to understand office workers' interest
            and preferences regarding break exercises, as well as to identify
            motivational factors and potential app features.

              <h4>Survey</h4>
              <br /><br />
              <p>
                The survey was conducted using Google Forms and it was open for
                approximately one and a half weeks. It was designed as a
                semi-structured questionnaire. A total of 34 responses were
                collected, with participants recruited through Facebook
                community groups
              </p>
            </summary>
            <br />
            <p>
              Themes of the survey:
              <span class="list-item"
                >Demographic information and respondents' physical activity
                habits
              </span>
              <span class="list-item">Features of the app</span>
              <span class="list-item">Motivation for break exercises</span
              ><br />
              The most popular features of the app were pre-set workouts
              categorized by duration. Personalization and reminders were also
              highlighted as important.
              <br /><br />
              We explored motivation for break exercises through an open-ended
              question. The responses were grouped into six main themes:
              <span class="list-item">time</span>
              <span class="list-item">personal health and well-being</span>
              <span class="list-item">exercising together</span>
              <span class="list-item">relieving muscle tension</span>
              <span class="list-item">reminders</span>
              <span class="list-item">other factors</span><br />
              Support and encouragement from employers were seen as necessary
              and even essential. In general, the benefits of break exercises
              for personal health and maintaining energy levels were seen as
              motivating. Additionally, the sense of community emerged as a
              motivating factor, with exercising together with colleagues being
              particularly encouraging.

        <p>
          From our research, we developed user personas, scenarios, a story map
          and user flows to gain a deeper understanding of users’ goals and how
          they interact with the app.

        <h3>First wireframes and navigation</h3>
        <p>
          Based on our background research, we started creating wireframes and
          exploring the overall structure of the app. At this stage, the visual
          style and potential gamified features were still rough ideas that
          evolved through multiple iterations.

        <h3>Iterating wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          The wireframes went through several rounds of iteration, during which
          the visual style began to take shape. For user testing, we created a
          high-fidelity prototype to test the app with target users.

            Five people participated in the testing.
            <br /><br />
            During the test, the users completed four tasks related to different
            features:
            <br />
            <span class="list-item">
              Evaluating the clarity of navigation

            <span class="list-item">General usability and visual design</span>
            <br />
            In addition to the tasks, the test users also filled out a
            background information form and prototype evaluation forms.
            <br /><br />
            The test sessions were recorded in the school facilities using two
            cameras, and written notes were also taken during the testing.

            This was the first project where we got to go through the entire
            design process from start to finish. I enjoyed conducting user
            research and user testing. User testing, in particular, was very
            valuable, as users pointed out things that we might have otherwise
            overlooked.
