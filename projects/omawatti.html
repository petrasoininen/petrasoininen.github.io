          <p>Mar 2023 - May 2023</p>
          <h4>Team</h4>
          <p>
            I worked with designers Melissa Airaksinen, Ville Forsberg and Veli

          </p>
          <h4>My role</h4>
          <p>
            The UI audit and overall design process were carried out
            collaboratively as a team. I was primarily responsible for the views
            for customer information and billing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was part of my studies at the Design Institute of LAB
            University of Applied Sciences.

          <h3>Goal of the project</h3>
          <p>
            The goal of the project was to redesign Lahti Energia’s OmaWatti
            platform where customers can monitor their energy usage and electric
            bills. We examined existing services using a UI audit and heuristic
            evaluation to identify the main pain points. Based on the research,
            our goal was to align the visual identity of the OmaWatti service to
            align with Lahti Energia's website, clarify functionalities and
            consumption tracking, and improve accessibility.

        <h3>UI audit</h3>
        <p>
          We examined OmaWatti through a UI audit and accessibility analysis.
          The evaluation was based on Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics.

        <p>Based on the evaluation, the main areas for improvement were:</p>

          <p>
            It was interesting to get the opportunity to redesign an existing
            service with a large customer base. The service included many
            different features and a lot of information to present, which made
            it challenging to display everything as clearly as possible. As my
            first client project, it was a very educational experience.
